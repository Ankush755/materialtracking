# Buildblock - Construction Material Tracking with Verified Origin and Carbon Footprint Price

## 🏗️ Project Description

Buildblock is a blockchain-based system designed to track construction materials from their source to the building site. The platform emphasizes transparency, enabling buyers and builders to verify the **origin** of materials and assess their **carbon footprint** and **price**.

## 🌍 Project Vision

To create a decentralized, transparent, and eco-conscious platform where construction material sourcing is traceable, sustainable, and accountable — reducing greenwashing and promoting environmentally responsible construction.

## ✨ Key Features

- ✅ **Add Verified Materials:** Suppliers can register materials with origin details and carbon emission data.
- 📦 **Track Origin & Emissions:** Every registered material stores data on where it's from and its carbon impact.
- 💸 **Dynamic Pricing Control:** Suppliers can update material prices, ensuring transparency in market rates.
- 🔍 **Public Access to Data:** Anyone can retrieve material information, making sourcing transparent.

## 🔮 Future Scope

- 🌐 Integration with IoT sensors for real-time carbon tracking.
- 📊 Carbon credit and offsetting system integration.
- 🤝 Supplier reputation scoring using smart contracts.
- 🔗 Cross-chain compatibility for supply chains.
- 📱 Frontend dApp for builder-friendly dashboards and visual tracking.
